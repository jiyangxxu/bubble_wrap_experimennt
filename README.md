# bubble_wrap_experimennt
Company BubbleBobble is a manufacturer of several types of protective packaging, including bubble wrap sold in both retail and bulk. The objective of this project is to determine the best operating conditions for the bubble wrap lines to increase production capacity.

## About the data set
Variables such as extrusion rate, temperature, line speed, and percent loading of additives were key factors that were considered in the study. After preliminary experiments, the engineers decided that line speed, and percent loading of additives were the most signiﬁcant factors and thus a complete randomized (also called factorial) design was implemented with these two factors and levels:

The response variable was the production rate measured in lbs/hr. The experiment was replicated 3 times and the randomization order for each replication was also recorded. During the experiment, the team of engineers observed that the quality of the bubble wrap was not acceptable for Replication 2, runs 2,3, and 5, which resulted in discarding the produced bubble wrap.

The goal is to ﬁnd the optimal combination of line speed and percent load of additives that results in the highest production rate.
